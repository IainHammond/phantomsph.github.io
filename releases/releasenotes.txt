-------------------
v1.0 - 13 Mar 2018
-------------------
Physics:
- working MPI implementation (Chan)
- more robust algorithm for one fluid dust (Ballabio+ 2018)
- dust algorithm (one fluid/two fluid) chosen at runtime not compile time
- particle waking with individual timesteps re-implemented (Wurster)
- universal disc setup routine (Mentiplay)
- setup added for flyby simulations (Mentiplay, Cuello)
- CO cooling implemented (Glover)
- magnetic field evolves B/rho rather than B (Tricco, Price)
- stellar wind routine works out-of-the-box (Toupin)
- improvemements to Galactic Centre winds and cooling (Russell, Price)
- NICIL updated to v1.2.3 (Wurster)

Bugs:
- updates/bug fixes to MESA Equation of state tabulation
- bug fix with energy conservation with softened sink particles
- bug fix with self-gravity + multiple particle types

Tests:
- nightly checks for non-ideal MHD added
- self gravity checked for all particle types
- testsuite checked nightly with MPI
