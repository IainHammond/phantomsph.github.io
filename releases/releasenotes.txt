-------------------
v1.1 - 5 Apr 2018
-------------------
Physics:
- Helmholtz equation of state implemented (Tricco)
- preliminary work on dust growth (Vericel)

Bugs:
- bug fix with magnetic fields on boundary particles
- bug fix with incorrect fatal error on centre of mass non-conservation
- angular momentum now conserved during sink particle accretion (#17, Wurster)
- issues with git-lfs fixed
- bug fix with write of B-field to small dump files

Tests:
- setupbot: Nightly checks that phantomsetup does not require unspecified user input

Setup:
- better defaults in several setups so we pass setupbot checks
- set_slab utility routine added for 2D-in-3D setups

Build:
- SYSTEM=raijin added

-------------------
v1.0 - 13 Mar 2018
-------------------
Physics:
- working MPI implementation (Chan)
- more robust algorithm for one fluid dust (Ballabio+ 2018)
- dust algorithm (one fluid/two fluid) chosen at runtime not compile time
- particle waking with individual timesteps re-implemented (Wurster)
- universal disc setup routine (Mentiplay)
- setup added for flyby simulations (Mentiplay, Cuello)
- CO cooling implemented (Glover)
- magnetic field evolves B/rho rather than B (Tricco, Price)
- stellar wind routine works out-of-the-box (Toupin)
- improvemements to Galactic Centre winds and cooling (Russell, Price)
- NICIL updated to v1.2.3 (Wurster)

Bugs:
- updates/bug fixes to MESA Equation of state tabulation
- bug fix with energy conservation with softened sink particles
- bug fix with self-gravity + multiple particle types

Tests:
- nightly checks for non-ideal MHD added
- self gravity checked for all particle types
- testsuite checked nightly with MPI
